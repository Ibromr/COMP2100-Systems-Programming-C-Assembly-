why people stop c to check out of array string so not have overflow issue?



Array Access (2)

To access the i ’th index element of an array A of type T:
• A[i] = *(A + sizeof(T)*i)

If A is an array of longs, and address of A is stored in register

%rdx, and i is stored in register %rcx, then
• movq (%rdx,%rcx,8), %rax



How a image size calculated in computer?

While more is better, remember that these bits add up. 
Consider 8-bit color depth. Each pixel requires 8 × 3 = 24 bits to represent its value.

Since each pixel requires 24 bits, 
and there are 1920 pixels per line and there are 1080 lines in one frame of video, 
this means that your hard-working flat-panel TV is showing you information that is 
24 × 1920 × 1080 = 49,766,400 bits in each frame. Approximately 50 million bits; 
also referred to as 50 Mbits.
