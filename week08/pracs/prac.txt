Machine Level Programming

The first priority in tutorials is your questions. Ask questions about the lectures and readings.

Questions adapted from the text book

Note: Some of the questions, particularly in chapter 3 of the textbook, are incorrect. The issue is
with the practice questions which were not written by the authors in the international edition of the
book.

Practice problem 3.1

Here are values stored in memory addresses and registers:

Address             Value of            Register                    Value
                    quadword

0x100               0xff                %rax                        0x100
0x108               0xab                %rcx                        0x1
0x110               0x13                %rdx                        0x3
0x118               0x11


Show the value of each of the following operands that might be used in an assembler instruction.
The first one is done as a (simple) example.

Operand             Address evaluated if               Value of operand
                    applicable

%rcx                Register                            0x1
